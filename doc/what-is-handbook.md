# What is the OSBR Handbook?

[[TOC]]

## 1. About Us

We are a development company working in collaboration with our parent company, Oz Co. Ltd., a creative media agency in Japan. Together, we bring ideas to life through campaigns, website development, advertising, and graphic design.

As a development team, we research and test emerging technologies to drive business growth and innovation. Our focus is on staying ahead of industry trends, making sure clients stay ahead in the digital space.

Beyond digital services, we believe in turning ideas into reality. Through our [Envisioned Projects](strategy.md#envision-project), we push creative and technological boundaries with hands-on, real-world initiatives. Explore our latest work on our website.s

## 2. Vision and Values

OSBR strives to grow into a **global enterprise** that goes beyond providing technical solutions. We see a future where technology is made to form the **foundation of new products and innovations**.

We inject meaningful value into every project we create through our business model. Expanding from **Oz in Japan**, our goal is to establish OSBR as a **powerhouse of creative media** in Malaysia while pioneering new products and constructing reputable business ideas.

Our journey is built upon three core values: **Be Nice, Be Kind, Be Strong**.

- **Think wholeheartedly** about consumers, users, and the colleagues you work with.
- **Offer a helping hand** when others are in need.
- **Cultivate strength**, because only through strength can we uplift others and make a difference.

It all begins here, in **Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia**.

## 3. The Handbook

At OSBR, we're actively shaping our **organizational culture** from the ground up. As a newly established company, we’re committed to building a strong foundation that reflects our **values, vision, and workflows**.

By referring the [GitLab model](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=57917), we have committed to develop the OSBR Handbook, a comprehensive guide publicly accessible as you can read this now. While our primary goal is to cultivate a strong internal culture, our open-access policy may also help refine OSBR’s identity by incorporating feedback from clients, partners, and potential collaborators.

In the **AI-Agent era**, maintaining **context-aware knowledge** is crucial. That’s why we write for both humans and AI—ensuring accuracy, accessibility, and seamless collaboration at every level of our projects, be it repository, pull requests or launced products.

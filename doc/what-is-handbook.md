## 3. The Handbook

At OSBR, we are in the early stages of shaping our organizational culture. As a newly established company, we recognize the importance of building a strong foundation that reflects our values, vision, and  workflows. 

So by referring the [GitLab model](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=57917), we have committed to developing the OSBR Handbook, a comprehensive guide publicly accessible as you can read this now. While our primary goal is to cultivate a strong internal culture, our open-access policy may also help refine OSBRâ€™s identity by incorporating feedback from clients, partners, and potential collaborators.

This is not just a traditional approach but rather a pragmatic way to maintain context awareness in the emerging AI-Agent era while retaining control over both the accuracy and accessibility of organization-wide knowledge for humans. For the same reason, we write text not only for humans but also for AI at the project, repository, and pull request levels.

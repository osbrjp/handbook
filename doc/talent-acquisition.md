## 1. The Mindset We Value in the AI Era

Like many early-stage startups, we are facing challenges in attracting top talent. However, with the rise of LLMs, the way we define skill as an effective capability is dynamically shifting. Even those who were once considered top professionals are now being pushed to adapt and transform.

While past achievements certainly deserve recognition, we believe the following factors are especially important at OSBR:

### 1-1. A Passion for Transcending AI Artifacts with AI

An ability to critically evaluate AI-generated artifacts—neither unconditionally accepting nor outright rejecting them, but discerning whether they are accurate or flawed, beneficial or harmful.

In other words, it is a mindset that seeks to go beyond AI artifacts by leveraging AI itself—creating greater value rather than merely replicating it. To pursue an even greater ideal, one must sharpen a deeper intellectual appetite which AI-generated artifacts alone can never satisfy. Additionally, it requires the patience to stay focused and persevere through intense cognitive challenges.

### 1-2. A Careful Insight into Semantic Integrity

A linguistic skill to enrich contextual vocabularies while avoiding ambiguity—ranging from individual words to broader conceptual frameworks, and from upstream to downstream processes.

We prioritize this skill because we believe that software design is, in essence, the design of a domain-specific language (DSL) that is sufficiently descriptive for building software. In this context, the meaning of "language" expands as follows:

#### Descriptive Languages  

| Format          | Name                | Comment  |
|----------------|---------------------|----------|
| Character-Based | Natural Language     | Descriptive across all levels of abstraction. |
| Character-Based | Programming Language | Executable as a formal expression with no ambiguity. |
| Graphical       | Graphic Image        | Represents an aspect of an object visually. |
| Graphical       | Movie                | Provides a more immersive representation through time-based transformation. |

These languages capture different aspects of an object from various perspectives. Ultimately, the key concern is not syntax but semantics. With a careful understanding of semantic integrity, we can describe objects with greater confidence. Otherwise, both humans and AI risk losing their way in ambiguity.

### 1-3. Emotional Intelligence Over Raw Intelligence  

In a world increasingly shaped by AI, emotional intelligence (EQ) matters more than ever. While technical skills and intellect (IQ) are valuable, the ability to understand, empathize, and connect with others is what truly drives meaningful collaboration and leadership.  

Empathy is not just an inherent trait but a skill that can be developed. Being kind, supportive, and strong at the same time is essential in any professional environment. Leadership, in particular, demands emotional resilience—not only making sound decisions but also maintaining a positive and composed demeanor. After all, a leader’s attitude sets the tone for the entire team.  

### 1-4. A Directive Mindset for Decision-Making  

A sense of directive thinking over binary thinking—in other words, a thoughtful mindset that seeks "better or worse" rather than simply concluding "right or wrong."  

In the dark, we may walk straight with a light in our hand, illuminating the ground to ensure each step. However, we lose our way when we raise our heads, letting the light sweep from east to west instead of guiding our path. In reality, the best direction is often somewhere between right and left, and the same applies to every software decision.  

Decision-making is not about finding the perfect answer but about choosing the best course of action in a given context. A directive mindset enables us to move forward despite uncertainty, refining our approach as we learn from experience.  

### 1-5. An Attitude That Retains Our Responsibility  

Some argue that the last remaining job for humanity will be to take responsibility for AI’s failures. This may sound dystopian, yet it is a compelling notion as AI agents increasingly demonstrate their ability to take over intellectual tasks.  

However, this is not necessarily a pessimistic outlook as long as we can assess and control AI’s outputs. Rather than competing with AI in producing ever-faster and more advanced results, it is more reasonable for humanity to focus on guiding and overseeing its development.  

Ultimately, responsibility cannot be shifted onto AI itself. No matter how advanced AI becomes, it lacks true agency or accountability. This makes individual responsibility more important than ever—ensuring that when problems arise, we have the ability to recognize, address, and resolve them effectively.
